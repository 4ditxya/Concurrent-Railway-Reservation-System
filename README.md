# Concurrent-Railway-Reservation-System
A multithreaded reservation system in Java allows multiple users to book, cancel, or view reservations concurrently. It uses threads to handle simultaneous requests and synchronization (e.g., using synchronized, ReentrantLock) to ensure data consistency and avoid race conditions during critical operations like seat booking.
